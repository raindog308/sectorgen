# sectorgen: full-featured sector maps for roleplaying games

sectorgen generates 8x10 space sector hex maps.  These are similar to the classic Traveller-style maps we all know and love, but with a different emphasis.

- All information is easily readable on the map. You don't need to look up hex 0506 to see generated data. Everything is represented in the hex itself.

- More narrative focus than simulationist. So instead of telling you the hydrosphere score, sectorgen gives you an icon representing a lighthouse icon. Does that mean that the mainworld has a strong seafaring culture, or that it's a warning point for interstellar danger, or that it's a beacon of hope?

sectorgen is a Python script is tunable on many dimensions. It produces a 6400x9000 PNG file. On a Macbook M1 Max, it takes between 8-10 seconds depending on how many hexes are settled.

The generated maps are finely detailed but are perfect for use on a tablet or computer where you can zoom in to focus on where you're adventuring.
